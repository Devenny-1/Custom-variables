    <p> This listing defines a variable named --main-font, and sets its value to a set of com
        mon sans-serif fonts. The name must begin with two hyphens (--) to distinguish it
         from CSS properties, followed by whatever name you’d like to use.
         Variables must be declared inside a declaration block. I’ve used the :root selector
         here, which sets the variable for the whole page—I’ll explain this shortly.
         By itself, this variable declaration doesn’t do anything until we use it. Let’s apply it
         to a paragraph to produce a result like that in figure 2.13
